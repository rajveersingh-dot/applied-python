TWO UP

A game of chance. The programs throws (virtually) two coins. 

Have the player choose to gamble on:
- heads (obverse)
- tails (reverse)
- head + tail (Ewan)

If they guess correctly, they win. If not, they lose.
Make sure the coin tosses are actually random. 

Example

Program : Please place your bet (HH, HT, or TT):
Player  : HH
Program : HT You lose!
Player  : TT
Program : TT You win!

You could have the player play multiple rounds and keep track of a score.
